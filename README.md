# MicroDbal Library

MicroDbal is a lightweight database abstraction library built on top of PHP's PDO. 
It aims to simplify common database operations with a simple API of most common features.
The underlying PDO instance is directly accessible if needed for use cases not covered by the library.

## Features
- Simplified database operations (fetching rows, executing queries, transactions, etc.)
- Lightweight and easy to integrate
- Helper methods for SQL `IN` clauses, `LIKE` clauses, and escaping
- Let use the underlying PDO instance directly if ever needed

## Tested with those Databases
- [x] SQLite
- [x] PostgreSQL
- [ ] MySQL/MariaDB
- [ ] Firebird
- [ ] ClickHouse
- [ ] DuckDB

Note that it should supports any databases that PHP PDO supports.

## Installation
Install via Composer:
```bash
composer require aLe/microdbal
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a list of all methods provided by the `MicroDbal` class:

- `__construct(string $dsn, ?string $username = null, ?string $password = null, array $options = [])`
- `run(string $sql, array $args = []): PDOStatement|false`
- `get(string $sql, array $args = []): array|false`
- `getAll(string $sql, array $args = []): array`
- `getRow(string $sql, array $args = []): array`
- `getFirstColumn(string $sql, array $args = []): array`
- `getOne(string $sql, array $args = []): mixed`
- `getOneObject(string $sql, string $className, array $args = [], array $constructorArgs = []): mixed`
- `getAllObjects(string $sql, string $className, array $args = [], array $constructorArgs = []): array`
- `getLastInsertedId(?string $name = null): string|false`
- `getRowCount(): int`
- `beginTrans(): bool`
- `commitTrans(): bool`
- `rollBackTrans(): bool`
- `inTrans(): bool`
- `sqlInInt(array $arr): string`
- `sqlInStr(array $arr): string`
- `sqlLikeEscape(string $str, string $escape = '\\'): string`


## Running Tests
To run tests using PHPUnit:
1. Install dependencies:
